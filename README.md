# introduction
An API REST (Application Programming Interface) is a set of paths used for many web applications and mobile app. It is an equivalent of a remote control for a TV. We send a request, we've got a response according to what the user want. 

Here, I have developped an API REST, where we have as an input a text, non-justified and the output is the text justified. 

We have two paths /api/justify to do the main part of the API and /api/token to authentify the user.
